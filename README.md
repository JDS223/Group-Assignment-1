# Group-Assignment-1
## What the program does
The program asks the user to input their name and birthdate. It then calculates their current age and zodiac sign and outputs them.

## Installation
The only requirement to get this program to run is Jupyter Notebook must be installed. The main file, **project.ipynb**, can simply be opened and ran directly in Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage
The program is very simple and only prompts the user to enter two inputs.

First, you just enter your name.

Next, you must enter your birthdate in the form **dd/mm/yyyy**. Make sure to include the slashes, and be cautious not to switch days and months in the input.
